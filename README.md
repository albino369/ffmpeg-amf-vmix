## 📖 What is this?

FFmpeg AMD AMF Proxy is an intelligent proxy that automatically converts CPU-based H.264 encoding (libx264) to AMD GPU-based H.264 encoding (h264_amf). It is designed for tools like vMix that don’t natively expose AMD encoders in their external-FFmpeg workflows, allowing you to keep your existing settings while offloading encoding to the GPU.

### Architecture

```
┌──────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│  vMix    │ ─────→  │ ffmpeg6.exe │ ─────→  │ ffmpeg.exe   │
│          │         │   (Proxy)   │         │  (Real AMF)  │
└──────────┘         └─────────────┘         └──────────────┘
   libx264              converts                  h264_amf
   (CPU)                                          (GPU)
```

---

## ✨ Features

- AMD AMF encoders: h264_amf (H.264/AVC), hevc_amf (H.265/HEVC), av1_amf (AV1).
- Transparent conversion: libx264 → h264_amf without changing your vMix profile.
- Preset mapping for low latency and balanced quality/speed trade-offs.
- FDK-AAC integrated and statically linked for high-quality AAC audio.
- Static Windows binaries (no external DLLs), cross-compiled from Linux/WSL2.
- Full logs: depure.log (build) and ffmpeg_proxy.log (runtime) for quick diagnostics.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build (Linux/WSL2)
- Ensure Ubuntu 20.04+ or WSL2 with basic build tools.
- Run the provided build script (vmixproxy.sh v46.2).
- Resulting artifacts will be in output/.

### Deploy (Windows)
Copy these files from output/ to %ProgramFiles(x86)%\vMix\streaming directory on Windows:
- ffmpeg6.exe — proxy (configure vMix to use this)
- ffmpeg.exe — real FFmpeg with AMF and FDK-AAC
- ffprobe.exe — analysis utility
- README.txt — quick reference

### Configure in vMix
- Settings → Encoders → External → point to ffmpeg6.exe.
- Keep your normal H.264/libx264 settings (bitrate, preset, etc.).
- The proxy converts to AMF automatically and uses the AMD GPU.

---

## 💻 Usage Examples

vMix external FFmpeg (conceptually):
- Your profile: H.264 (libx264), veryfast, 6000 kbps
- Proxy conversion: h264_amf, usage=lowlatency, quality=speed, 6000 kbps

---

## 🔄 How it Works

The proxy inspects and transforms common H.264 options into AMF equivalents:

| Original (x264)      | Converted (AMF)                        | Purpose          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| -codec:v libx264     | -codec:v h264_amf                      | Use AMD GPU      |
| -preset ultrafast    | -usage speed -quality speed            | Max speed        |
| -preset veryfast     | -usage lowlatency -quality speed       | Low latency      |
| -preset fast         | -usage lowlatency -quality balanced    | Balanced         |
| -preset medium       | -usage transcoding -quality balanced   | Quality/balance  |
| -preset slow/slow+   | -usage transcoding -quality quality    | Highest quality  |
| -crf N               | -b:v (heuristic mapping)               | Stable bitrate   |
| -tune zerolatency    | (removed)                              | Not needed in AMF|

Notes:
- CRF-to-bitrate mapping is heuristic to preserve approximate visual quality; adjust -b:v to your needs.
- Flags without an AMF equivalent are safely ignored to avoid errors.

---

## 📊 Performance (Typical)

- CPU usage drops from ~100% to ~10–20% by moving H.264 encoding to the AMD GPU.
- GPU usage typically 60–80% during live encoding (depends on card and settings).
- Lower CPU temperature and improved system responsiveness under streaming load.
- Low-latency path enabled via AMF usage lowlatency where applicable.

---

## ✅ Requirements

Runtime (Windows):
- Windows 10/11
- AMD GPU RX 400 series or newer
- AMD Adrenalin drivers 22.10.1 or newer

Build (Linux/WSL2):
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or WSL2
- Standard build tools (installed by script)
- vmixproxy.sh v46.2 script

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common checks:
- Both ffmpeg6.exe (proxy) and ffmpeg.exe (real) must be in the same directory.
- Verify AMF encoders are present: ffmpeg.exe -encoders | findstr amf
- If vMix fails to start FFmpeg, open ffmpeg_proxy.log to see the rewritten command line.

FDK-AAC dependency:
- Version 46.2 adds explicit include/lib paths to the FFmpeg configure, resolving “libfdk_aac not found” on clean systems.

Quality tuning:
- If the result is too soft at your CRF, increase -b:v or switch to a higher-quality preset mapping (e.g., medium → transcoding+balanced, slow → transcoding+quality).

---

## 📝 Changelog

### v1.0 (46.2) — Stable
- Transparent proxy for libx264 → h264_amf (vMix-friendly).
- FFmpeg static build with AMF and FDK-AAC integration.
- Definitive fix for “libfdk_aac not found” via explicit include/lib paths.
- Robust preset mapping and safe removal of incompatible flags.
- Detailed build and runtime logs for easy debugging.

Previous (internal) milestones:
- v46.1: Added FDK-AAC artifact/header verification and clearer errors.
- v46.0: Initial working proxy + AMF pipeline validation.

---

## 🧭 Future implementations

- Next: AV1 proxy (av1_amf) targeting RDNA3-class GPUs, optimized for AMD RX 7000+ series; the proxy will transparently map common x264/VP9/SVT-AV1 options to av1_amf for low-latency streaming profiles where possible.  
- Add preset mappings for AV1 (speed/balanced/quality) with sensible defaults per use case (live → speed/lowlatency, VOD → quality/transcoding).  
- Validate compatibility and performance across multiple AMF driver versions and RX 7000+ SKUs, and publish tuning guides (bitrate ladders, GOP, lookahead, VBV).  
- Expand proxy rules to handle mixed workloads (e.g., auto-fallback to H.264 AMF if AV1 AMF is unavailable or unstable on a given driver/hardware combo).  
- Improve diagnostics: richer ffmpeg_proxy.log with before/after argument snapshots, driver caps dump, and AMF encoder warnings surfaced to users.
